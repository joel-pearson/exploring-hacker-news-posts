Dataquest project02: Exploring Hacker News Posts

---

This project aims to analyse posts on a social network site to analyse different types of post and gain insights into which ones gain more comments, upvotes etc based on the times in which they are posted. 

The main focus of this work is to develop my own understanding of data science and apply what I have learnt so far (on dataquest) to a realistic data analysis application.

Project Spec:

"*In this project, we'll work with a dataset of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News.*

*Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.*

*Note that we have reduced the dataset from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that didn't receive any comments and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions*

*We're specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting.*

*We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:*
- *Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?*
- *Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?*"
